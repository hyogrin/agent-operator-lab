    "# Control Plane: Connect Hosted Agent using Hosting Adapter\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook summarizes—through an **Azure AI Foundry Control Plane** lens—how to take a locally built agent and use the **Hosting Adapter** to expose it  with the **Foundry SDK (2.0.0b2 preview)** as a **Foundry-compatible HTTP service** with minimal effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Hosting Adapter?\n",
    "The Hosting Adapter is an abstraction layer that **automatically converts popular agent frameworks (e.g., LangGraph)** into **Microsoft Foundry protocol-compliant HTTP services**.  \n",
    "It removes the need to manually build REST endpoints, message handling, or streaming logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key benefits\n",
    "- **One-line local hosting**: e.g., `from_langgraph(my_agent).run()` → instantly serves a Foundry-compatible service on `localhost:8088` (endpoints + streaming included)\n",
    "- **Automatic protocol translation**:\n",
    "    - Conversation management\n",
    "    - Message serialization/deserialization\n",
    "    - Foundry-style streaming event generation\n",
    "- **Built-in production essentials**:\n",
    "    - OpenTelemetry tracing\n",
    "    - CORS support\n",
    "    - SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming\n",
    "    - Structured logging\n",
    "- **Seamless Foundry integration**: Works directly with Foundry **Responses API**, conversation flows, and authentication patterns—simplifying the path from local development to Azure production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook covers\n",
    "- High-level flow to **host an agent as a Foundry-compatible service** using the Hosting Adapter\n",
    "- Basic **Control Plane-style checks** (agent/resource visibility and trace verification)"
